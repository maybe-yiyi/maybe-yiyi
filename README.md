# Salve, ego Yiyoung sum!

I am a freshman studying Information Systems at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), hoping to get a minor in Computer Science as well. <br>
I'm interested in computer systems, emergent intelligence, and computer graphics! <br>
I would also totally be studying physics (quantum mechanics & co.) if I wasn't studying tech.

## Things I love studying
* Quantum mechanics (specifically QFT and particle physics)
* Algebra and analysis (specifically category theory and functional analysis)
* Languages (Ancient Greek right now)
* Biochem (specifically metabolic processes)
* Of course, computer science (computer systems and graphics)

## Things I don't love studying
* Algorithms
* Statistical mechanics
* Number theory
* Fluid mechanics

## What I'm up to
* Working on a CMU Discord bot to help with courses, dining locations, and other fun features
* A rewrite of my chaotic attractor simulator because I am a better person now and have good ideas
* suffering in school
