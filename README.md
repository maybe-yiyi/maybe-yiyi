# Hey y'all, I'm Yiyoung Liu!

I am a freshman studying Information Systems at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), hoping to get a minor in Computer Science as well. <br>
I'm interested in computer systems, emergent intelligence, and computer graphics! <br>
I would also totally be studying physics (quantum mechanics & co.) if I wasn't studying tech.<br>
I love studying math (to learn more physics)

## What I'm up to
* Working on a CMU Discord bot to help with courses, dining locations, and other fun features
* suffering in school
